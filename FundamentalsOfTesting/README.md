## Fundamentals of Testing

### Module Summary:

Do you know what a testing framework does? Do you know what makes a testing framework different from a testing or assertion library? The best way to use a tool effectively is to understand how it works. And the best way to understand how a tool works is by making it yourself!

In this short course, weâ€™ll learn how testing frameworks and assertion libraries work by building our own, simple version of each.

### Building a simple automated testing framework

Lesson Order:

1.  `simple.js`
2.  `assertion-library.js`
3.  `testing-framework.js`
4.  `async-await.js`
5.  `globals.js`
6.  `jest.test.js`

The files are intended to test the `math` module.

To run the files, run `node lessons/<lesson-filename>.js`.

> For the `global` one, run `node -r ./setup-globals.js ./lessons/globals.js`
>
> For the `jest.test.js` one, run `npx jest`.
